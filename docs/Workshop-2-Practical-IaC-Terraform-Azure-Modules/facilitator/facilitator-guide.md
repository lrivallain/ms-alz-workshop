3. **Resource Dependencies** (10 minutes):

   ```terraform
   # Show implicit vs explicit dependencies
   resource "azurerm_linux_web_app" "main" {
     service_plan_id = azurerm_service_plan.main.id  # Implicit
     depends_on      = [azurerm_storage_account.main] # Explicit
   }
   ```

   resource "random_string" "unique" {
     length = 8  # Increase from 6
   }
   ```

2. **Azure Provider Authentication**:

   ```bash
   # Re-authenticate if needed

   ```

3. **Configuration Patterns**:

   ```terraform
   # Demonstrate environment-specific configurations
   sku_name = var.environment == "prod" ? "P1v3" : "B1"
   ```

**Troubleshooting AVM Issues**:

1. **Module Source Issues**:

   ```bash
   # Clear module cache
   rm -rf .terraform/modules
